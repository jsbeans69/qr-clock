# qr-clock
a simple html page that displays a qrcode with your devices current time encoded within it, updating every minute.
note that this every minute is linked to the codes runtime and not the actual time.

there are 2 versions.

qrclock-o.html requires an internet connection to run as it calls this script 
"https://cdn.rawgit.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs/gh-pages/qrcode.min.js" to generate the qrcode.

qrclock-l.html is suposed to be able to run locally by modifying line 5 to where ever you may have a local copy of 
"https://cdn.rawgit.com/davidshimjs/qrcodejs/gh-pages/qrcode.min.js" but I simply cannot get it to work on android 
(it should be easy on a personal computer).



i made this in a weekend because i thought the idea of a qrcode clock was hilarious and i told my teacher 
that i would make this useless clock for an assignment.
if this code helps you if you are in a similar situation just claim you made it and impress whoever is assesing you.

if anyone can help me figure out how to get the local version to work on android please do.
otherwise i hope this can be as much a burdon on your home as it is mine.
